- Access the admin panel at `/admin`
- Re-import words from words.txt
- View system statistics
- Access Prisma Studio

## üß† Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The app uses a variant of the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm:

### Rating Scale (0-5)
- **0** - Complete blackout, didn't know at all
- **1** - Incorrect, but recognized on second try
- **2** - Incorrect, but remembered with hint
- **3** - Correct response with difficulty
- **4** - Correct response with hesitation  
- **5** - Perfect response

### Learning Progression
1. **New words** start with 1-day intervals
2. **Successful reviews** increase intervals exponentially
3. **Failed reviews** reset to 1-day intervals
4. **Ease factor** adjusts based on performance history
5. **Words become "learned"** after consistent success

## üéØ Study Strategies

### Effective Learning Tips
1. **Daily consistency** - Study a little each day rather than cramming
2. **Review due words first** - Prioritize spaced repetition reviews
3. **Use example sentences** - Context helps with retention
4. **Star difficult words** - Focus extra attention on challenging vocabulary
5. **Take quizzes regularly** - Test recall in different formats

### Difficulty Levels
- **Level 1-2** - Common words, basic vocabulary
- **Level 3** - Intermediate SAT words
- **Level 4-5** - Advanced, complex vocabulary
